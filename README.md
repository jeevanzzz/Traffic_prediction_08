TRAFFIC PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING 
 
Abstract: The paper deals with traffic prediction that the Traffic congestion is a persistent 
issue in urban environments, leading to economic losses, environmental concerns, and driver 
frustration. Accurate traffic prediction can empower individuals and authorities make informed 
decisions that mitigate these problems. 
This paper explores the application of machine learning algorithms for traffic flow prediction, 
considering various influential factors. We discuss the importance of traffic volume data, along 
with weather information (temperature, climate, and description), temporal data (date, time, 
and potentially day of the week), and potentially including holiday status. We delve into the 
suitability of deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, 
for handling sequential traffic data and learning the complex relationships between traffic 
volume and these factors.  
The paper outlines the training process and prediction methodology, where users can input 
specific date, time, weather details, and potentially holiday status to receive a predicted traffic 
volume. We highlight the potential benefits of such a system, including improved traffic 
management, enhanced navigation for individuals, and informed decision-making for 
businesses. By incorporating diverse data points through machine learning, this approach offers  
potential for more accurate and nuanced traffic predictions, ultimately contributing to amore 
efficient transportation system.

INTRODUCTION:
Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most important and popular emerging branches these 
days are a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In recent times, machine learning becomes an 
essential and upcoming research area for transportation engineering, especially in traffic 
prediction. Traffic congestion affects the country’s economy directly or indirectly by its 
means. Traffic congestion also takes people’s valuable time, cost of fuel every single day. 
As traffic congestion is major problem for all classes in society, there has to be a small
scale traffic prediction for people’s sake of living their lives without frustration or tension. 
For ensuring the country’s economic growth, the road user’s ease is required in first place. 
This is possible only when the traffic flow is smooth. To deal with this, Traffic prediction 
is needed so that we can estimate or predict the future traffic to some extent. 
 
In addition to the country’s economy, pollution can also be reduced. The government is also 
investing in intelligent transportation system (ITS) to solve these issues. The plot of this 
research paper is to find different machine learning algorithms and speculating the models 
by utilizing python3. The goal of traffic prediction is to predict traffic to users as soon as 
possible. Nowadays the traffic becomes really hectic and this cannot be determined by the 
people when they are on roads. So, this research can be helpful to predict traffic.  
 
"While Anaconda is popular choice for machine learning due to its environment 
management and pre-installed libraries, this paper explores an alternative approach using 
Python's core libraries within Visual Studio Code environment. This approach leverages a 
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor model for traffic prediction and deploys the 
solution using Flask, HTML. This demonstrates the effectiveness of developing and 
deploying machine learning models with readily available tools." 
 
Purpose of Research: 
Many reports of the traffic data are actual time but it is not favorable and accessible to many 
users as we need to have prior decision in which route we need to travel. For example, 
During working days, we need to have daily traffic information or at times we need hourly 
traffic information but then the traffic congestion occurs; for solving this issue the user need 
have actual time traffic prediction. Many factors are responsible for the traffic congestion. 
Users can make well-informed judgments regarding their routes, resulting in better traffic 
flow and a more effective transportation system, by integrating real-time traffic data with 
precise projections. The traffic prediction dataset includes data on a number of variables 
that could affect the flow of traffic. The dataset attempts to capture the intricate interactions 
between different elements influencing traffic flow aggregating all of this information. 
Afterwards, using this data, machine learning models may be trained forecast future traffic 
volumes and assist users in choosing their routes with knowledge. 

Problem Statement: 
To overcome the problem of traffic congestion, the traffic prediction using machine learning 
which contains regression model and libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot are 
used to predict the traffic. This has to be implemented so that the traffic congestion is 
controlled and can be accessed easily. Users can collect the traffic information of the traffic 
flow and can also check the congestion flow from the start of the day till end of the day 
with the time span of one hour data. In this way, Users can know the weather conditions of 
the roads that they would probably opt to take. This also tells the accuracy of the traffic by 
comparing their Mean Square errors and Inverse Scaling in Traffic Prediction. 

In Conclusion, 
The research on traffic prediction using machine learning has highlighted that 
machine learning models, especially those leveraging deep learning techniques, can 
significantly enhance accuracy of traffic flow predictions. By analyzing various features such 
as time of day, weather conditions, holiday data, these models provide real-time traffic updates 
that help alleviating congestion and improving urban traffic management systems. The 
implementation of regression models using comprehensive datasets has shown promising 
results, with metrics such as mean square error indicating the models' effectiveness in 
predicting traffic conditions accurately. 
The implementation of regression model using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle has 
illustrated the potential of machine learning in providing real-time traffic updates. The use of 
various features such time of day, weather conditions, and holiday information has proven 
crucial in improving the predictive power of the models. Visualization techniques, including 
heatmaps and histograms etc, have been instrumental in understanding the data distribution and 
relationships among different features. 
Overall, the integration of machine learning techniques into intelligent transportation systems 
(ITS) can lead better traffic management, reduced congestion, and improved decision-making 
for commuters and city planners. The results underline the importance of continued research 
and development in field to further enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
